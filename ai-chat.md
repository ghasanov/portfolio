# AI Chat Usage

## Purpose

This file explains how AI tools were used during the development of my personal portfolio website hosted at https://ghasanov.github.io/portfolio/.

## How AI Was Used

During the project work, AI was used as an **assistant for learning and problem-solving**. Specifically, AI helped with:

- Clarifying HTML and CSS structure, layout, and template section usage.
- Debugging and understanding terminal/git errors during Git/GitHub operations.
- Generating ideas for descriptions, section content, and phrasing.
- Clarifying best practices for GitHub Pages deployment.

## What I Did Myself

All final work, including writing and editing code, customizing the template, choosing links, images, and deploying the website, was completed by me.

In short:
- I wrote all HTML/CSS and customized the design.
- I added my own content, images, sections, and links.
- I used Git and GitHub to manage commits and deploy the site.
- I reviewed and corrected AI guidance to ensure accuracy.

## Important Note

AI was used only as a **learning tool** and to assist with explanations, examples, and suggestions.  
No AI-generated code was blindly copied; I reviewed and edited everything by myself.
